    <h1 align="center">about me</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">my pen name is amychi, but people call me amy!<br> i have always loved to draw for as long as i can remember, and i have many interests. I like to paint, draw, animate, video edit, and as of last year, started coding.<br> I have made many many projects before but this is the first that i will be putting up online!<br> i have also dabbled in music production and it was a pretty pleasant experience that i would like to do again but sadly i have been too caught up in other things like school to practice it more so i am still a novice at it (my <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/728863784/" target="_blank">scratch page</a> has 3 snippets of 10+ tracks i made back then if you want to check it out).<br>I have done commisions before, using virtual currency and robux but i have closed them for a long time right now.<br><br> Currently, i don't have a drawing tablet and was just using my phone(rip) before i got my computer.</p>
